# _Baby Monitor_

The goal for this project is to create a simple baby monitor (inspired by Owlet). I want to see the pros/cons of FreeRTOS with a hands-on project. This project will start off simple using ESP32 microcontroller and a simple pulse ox/heart rate monitor module (MAX30102). This is not a complicated system by any means, but I'd like to see how far we can take this and also expose myself to some different APIs like Wifi and BT. Would I use this on my child? We'll see!


## Hardware

- ESP-WROOM-32
- MAX30102 Heart Rate Sensor Module Pulse Detection Blood Oxygen Concentration Module
- 4.7k resistor
